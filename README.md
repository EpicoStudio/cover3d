# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why would I need this?
Do you have a book (or an e-book) that you want to promote? Or a subscription form with a lead magnet to download an e-book for marketing purposes? Including a 3D cover can help grab the visitor's attention to them, increasing conversions.

## What is the recommended way to use it?
It can be used anywhere in the WordPress block editor, either in your content or in your templates.

## What is the recommended size for my cover image file?
The plugin offers three sizes for your cover: _small_, _medium_ and _big_. The minimum image size for the “small” option is *66 x 100 pixels*. For the “Medium” option, upload an image with at least *133 x 200 pixels*, and *200 x 300 pixels* for the “big” option.

## What image file formats do this plugin accept?
You can use any of the [natively supported file types](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/image-size-and-quality/) for images, like JPG, GIF or PNG. If your WordPress installation allows SVG file uploads, you can also use this format, which is specially good for covers with sharp details.

## Will this plugin hinder my website loading performance?
The Cover3D plugin uses very little CSS (8kb) to create the animation effect without Javascript on the front-end, so is very lean. You can also include an image for your cover, but you can select the desired image size to minimize the performance impact. At any rate, the Cover3D block only uses the native `medium` size, defined in your WordPress admin panel (Settings → Media), for the cover image on small screens, regardless of the the size option choosen in the block control panel, in order to avoid negative impacts on loading performance.

## Does this plugin collect any data from me or my users?
Not at all. The plugin respects your privacy. It's completely add-free and the code only uses core WordPress functions. No admin notices or hidden “call home” functions.

## Does this plugin work in the Classic Editor?
No, this plugin works exclusively in the Block Editor.

## Does the hover animation work in touchscreen devices?
Since touchscreen devices do not include a “hover” state, the animation is disabled on them.

## How can I support the development of the Cover3D plugin?
You can help with a [donation](https://ubr.link/donate-wp) or a [positive review](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/cover3d/reviews/#new-post), if you find it useful.
